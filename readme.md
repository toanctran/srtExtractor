### Requisitos:

1. **ffmpeg**install

2. **Python 3** install


------------

### How to run

With everything installed, dragging the video on top of the 01.extract_srt.py file you will extract the raw srt (with tags and timestamps) in the source folder. Good for searches and queries.

Drag the resulting srt on top of the 02.clear_srt.py file to clear the file by generating a text file in the source folder.
